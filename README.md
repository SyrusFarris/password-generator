# Password Generator


# Description
This is the 3rd challende for the Web Development bootcamp where I have created a password generator that can be used by a user to create a password that can contain spcial characters, lower case, upper case, variable length between 8-128 characters, and numbers. The user will follow a series of prompts and based off of these prompts generate a password that will for the instructions the user has given.



# Difficulties
I struggled with creating a functions that interacted appropriately with the chosen prompts that the user can select to accuratley display what the user wanted within their password. I had to reach out to other students in the bootcamp to combat this and their help was tremendous. This resulted in me having to create another repository where I had to move majority of my previous code from earlier attempts in to this one.
